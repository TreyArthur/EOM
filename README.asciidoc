Jupyter Notebook on the Equations of Motion README
==================================================

This notebook reads in [DAVE-ML](https://daveml.org/) models, initial conditions
and then runs a simulation based on the equations of motion.  The results of 
the simulation are then compared to 
[NESC check cases](https://nescacademy.nasa.gov/flightsim/)
